This is a simple Flutter application written in Dart. Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The code defines a basic counter app with a button to increment the counter. Let's break down the code:

1. Import statement:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```
This imports the `material.dart` package, which provides Material Design widgets and other basic UI components.

2. Main function:
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
This is the entry point of the application. It calls the `runApp` function and passes an instance of the `MyApp` class, which is a custom StatelessWidget.

3. MyApp StatelessWidget:
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```
The `MyApp` class extends `StatelessWidget`, which means it describes part of the UI that does not depend on any mutable state. The `build` method returns a `MaterialApp` widget with some properties set, such as title, theme, and home.

4. MyHomePage StatefulWidget:
```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}
```
The `MyHomePage` class extends `StatefulWidget`, which means it can hold mutable state. It has a required `title` property, and its `createState` method returns an instance of `_MyHomePageState`.

5. _MyHomePageState class:
```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
This class represents the mutable state for `MyHomePage`. It has a private `_counter` field and an `_incrementCounter` method that increases the counter's value when called. The `build` method returns a `Scaffold` widget with an `AppBar`, a `Center` widget containing a `Column` with text widgets displaying the counter value, and a `FloatingActionButton` that increments the counter when pressed.
